# Stockflare Internationalization (I18n)

Here, you will find all of the individuals translations that are currently used on the [Stockflare website](https://stockflare.com).

Our primary mission at Stockflare, is to help everybody to invest. We don't want to exclude anybody, simply because they can't read English. Therefore, this translation project is an open source effort, to ensure that Stockflare is usable by as many people as possible.

We are __always__ looking for new translators that can help to translate Stockflare. If you would like to see Stockflare translated into your native language, we would love for you to get in touch, please feel free to send a message to [info@stockflare.com](mailto:info@stockflare.com).

You can also [find this project on LocaleApp](http://www.localeapp.com/projects/7693).
